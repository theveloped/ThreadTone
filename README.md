# ThreadTone | a halftone representation of an image made of thread

The process of generating an image with thread is an idea of [Petros Vrellis](http://artof01.com/vrellis/index.html). As I've documented [here](http://www.thevelop.nl/blog/2016-12-25/Thread-tone/) the process is comprised of three steps:
  
  * Image pre-processing (cropping, resizing, etc.)
  * Algorithm to place threads
  * In my case parsing the result to G-Code for automated fabrication

A set of two example images can be found below. Please refer to my [blog](http://www.thevelop.nl/blog/2016-12-25/Thread-tone/) for more details.
